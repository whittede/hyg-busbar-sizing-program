Upon changing the source code of any files related to 
the program or upon adding any data entries to the csv files,
the program can and should be re-compiled as a single executable
for distribution.
One method of compilation as an executable is by using the 
PyInstaller application. After installing PyInstaller, 
simply navigate to the directory of this file and run the
command "pyinstaller --noconsole -D hysterYaleBusbarSizing.py" (without
the quotes).

After PyInstaller has compiled the program into one file, it is necessary
to manually copy all of the .csv files, the .ico files, and the .png 
files into the folder generated by PyInstaller. Otherwise, the executable
program will not run.
